This project was created with help from the Game Engines teaching assistant Parisa.
The models were sourced from a opensource tile pack from the following link. https://quaternius.com/packs/ultimateplatformer.html

Part 1:
My GDW game will be making a game where you take down a boss in a tile based arena. 
One thing important to use is procedural generation and a randomized arena everytime 
you play. I will be working as a technical artist to make 3d models as well as implement
UI and particle affects onto characters and items. Because of the procedural generation my 
main contribution will be a tileset of models that are completely tileable so our random 
generator will be able to place them wherever it decides. I would also like to make 4 or 5 
versions of each natural object to make sure it does not look as if rock tiles are all the 
same copy and pasted rock or tree.


Part 2:
In the first week of tutorials the main thing we learned was how to use the new unity
input system. The new system is mostly done in an editor opposed to the old unity system 
done through code and getkeys. We learned how to take vector inputs like WASD as well as
button presses like space for jump and mouse for delta pointer. My main takeaway from this
week was about how new more visual systems can be just as efficient and in depth as the code
versions. This lab actually inspired me to take another crack at learning unitys visual 
coding which is something we briefly covered in a tutorial last year.

Part 3:
Week 2 included a lot more than week one, one of the main things working on were parent/child
class systems with things like a following main camera and bullets that will be launched from 
the end of the player's gun. We began working on an editor system that would allow us to create
and delete objects while the game is running. The most interesting thing I learned that week 
was about object optimization and how to reuse items to reduce the lag associated with object
creation and deletion. One way we used this was with our bullets, we only had two bullets and
they would be perpetually reused after each one was fired to make sure we didnâ€™t have to create 
an item every time the player shot.
